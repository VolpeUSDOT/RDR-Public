# Resilience and Disaster Recovery (RDR) Tool Suite

## Description:

The RDR Tool Suite enables transportation agencies to assess transportation resilience return on investment (ROI) for specific transportation assets over a range of potential future conditions and hazard scenarios, which can then be used as a consideration in existing project prioritization processes. The tool suite utilizes established Robust Decision-Making concepts developed to build on current TDM analyses and address deeply uncertain future scenarios. The RDR Tool Suite was developed at the US Dept. of Transportation's Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in support of FHWA and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.

## Installation and Usage:

The RDR Tool Suite is a Python based tool.

The RDR Exposure Analysis Tool and components of other helper tools are ESRI ArcGIS Pro based tools.

Installation instructions are provided in the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/VolpeUSDOT/RDR-Public/blob/main/documentation/RDR_GettingStarted_final.pdf), and more detailed usage instructions are provided in the [User Guide](https://github.com/VolpeUSDOT/RDR-Public/blob/main/documentation/RDR_UserGuide_final.pdf).

- Download the latest release on the [Releases page](https://github.com/VolpeUSDOT/RDR-Public/releases).
