# PARAMETERS

# Run name
# Used to name output file for distinction between various hazard scenarios
run_name = 'RDR_0yr3SLR'

# Link Availability Approach
# Defines the approach used to convert exposure to a specific level of disruption to each individual segment in the
# road network
# 'Binary' = any value > 0 will be considered full exposure and link will not be available. Other links will remain fully available
# 'Default_Flood_Exposure_Function' = Utilize Depth-Disruption function adapted from Pregnolato et al
# 'Manual' = Develop your own bins representing converting exposure into link availability based on template csv provided with tool
# 'Beta_Distribution_Function' = Develop custom function converting exposure to disruption-- based on Excel's beta distribution function implementation
link_availability_approach = 'Default_Flood_Exposure_Function'

# Exposure Field
# Field name in the exposure dataset which defines exposure level
# Default is 'Value' but this may vary depending on the specific dataset
exposure_field = 'Value'

# Exposure Unit
# Units in which exposure is measured
# Acceptable units are feet, meters, or yards
# Only required if flood exposure curve is being utilized
exposure_unit = 'Feet'

# Search Distance
# Search distance for determining the maximum level of exposure along a road segment-- recommend using a search distance
# that is at least half of the exposure dataset's grid size, to ensure that all overlapping exposure values are captured
# Include units (e.g. Feet, Meters or Yards)
search_distance = '5 Feet'

# Fields To Keep
# Identifies the column names from the road network to be retained in final output.
# Surround full list with single quotes, separate each field with comma and no spaces
# If using the output of this tool in the RDR metamodel, ensure that an integer-based unique link_id field is one of the fields to keep.
# These link IDs must correspond to the same link IDs used to identify unique segments in your other RDR input files.
fields_to_keep = 'link_id,A,B'

# Comment Text
# Optional description of the hazard scenario to be passed on as a column in the output
# Can be left blank
comment_text = '3 ft sea level rise with no storm surge depth grid- September revision'

# The following parameters need only to be defined when the beta_distribution_function approach is utilized to convert
# a hazard to disruption
# Alpha
# A number greater than 0 that helps define the shape of the beta distribution.
alpha = 1
# Beta
# A number greater than 0 that helps define the shape of the beta distribution.

# The exposure value where link availability reaches 0% (if lower cumulative beta distribution function is utilized)
# or 100% (if upper cumulative beta distribution function is utilized).

# Upper Bound
# The exposure value where link availability reaches 100% (if lower cumulative beta distribution function is utilized)

# Beta Method-- user can select 'lower cumulative' or 'upper cumulative'. If lower cumulative, link availability reaches
# 0% at lower bound and 100% at the upper bound.
# If upper cumulative, link availability reaches 100% at lower bound and 0% at upper bound
# In either method, link availability will always be 100% for links with no (NULL) hazard exposure.

# that is distinct from link availability for the typical vehicle. Instead of outputting "link_availability", the tool
# will output "link_availability_emergency"
