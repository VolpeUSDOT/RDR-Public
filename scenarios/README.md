# RDR Tool Suite Scenario Examples

## Description:
The `scenarios` folder contains several examples of RDR analyses to help users get familiar with the file setup and input data required to run different RDR scenarios. There is one Quick Start and six Reference Scenarios in this folder, each illustrating a different aspect of the RDR Tool Suite. All examples are detailed in the RDR documentation, either in the [Getting Started with RDR](https://github.com/VolpeUSDOT/RDR-Public/blob/main/documentation/RDR_GettingStarted_final.pdf) guide or the [Scenario Examples](https://github.com/VolpeUSDOT/RDR-Public/blob/main/documentation/RDR_ScenarioExamples_final.pdf) documentation.

## Usage:
Each scenario example is provided fully packaged in its own folder. Each folder contains one (or more) batch files used to execute the run, one (or more) configuration files used to specify details about the run, and an input data folder with all required input files for the run. If the user has set up their RDR installation as explained in the [RDR User Guide documentation](https://github.com/VolpeUSDOT/RDR-Public/blob/main/documentation/RDR_UserGuide_final.pdf), they should be able to run each example as is.
